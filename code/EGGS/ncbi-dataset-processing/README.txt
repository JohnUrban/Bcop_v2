Genome datasets were downloaded from NCBI.

Each species had its own directory, inside of which was a NCBI directory structure that looked something like:
- ncbi_dataset/data/GCF*/
	- Inside of which are files like:
		- genomic.gtf 
		- protein.faa 
		- genomic.gff 
- In some cases "GCA*" is needed, not "GCF*".

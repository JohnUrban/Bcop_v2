# Evidence for neighboring contig ends
- Note some of the code in here is older than the code found here: ../../cHiCk/
- The code in this directory was used for the analysis in the paper, and eventually evolved into cHiCk.
- Thus the code here is referred to as "deprecated";
	- cHiCk-functions.deprecated.txt 
- One can also try sourcing the functions from there inside the bash scripts in this dir.

# Bash scripts
- cmd-windows.sh	
	- Makes windows
- example-sep-ends-pipeline.sh
	- Example script for analyzing left and right ends of given contig separately.
- example-whole-interval-pipeline.sh
	- Example script for analyzing whole contig.
- contig_103/cmd.sh 
	- Code used to analyze contig_103
- contig_103/2024june25.sh

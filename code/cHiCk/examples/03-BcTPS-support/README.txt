In general, the code in these directories is older than the code in the cHiCk software directory.
- much will be the same.

Where commands look to find stuff in "deepseep" directories, that was just an older name for "cHiCk" directories.
- I changed the name to cHiCk b/c I couldn't remember why I named it deepseep. :P
